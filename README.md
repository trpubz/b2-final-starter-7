## Extensions
- When an invoice is pending, a merchant should not be able to delete or edit a bulk discount that applies to any of their items on that invoice.
- When an Admin marks an invoice as “completed”, then the discount percentage should be stored on the invoice item record so that it can be referenced later
- Merchants should not be able to create/edit bulk discounts if they already have a discount in the system that would prevent the new discount from being applied (see example 4)

API Consumption Extensions:
```
Holidays API

As a merchant
When I visit the discounts index page
I see a section with a header of "Upcoming Holidays"
In this section the name and date of the next 3 upcoming US holidays are listed.

Use the Next Public Holidays Endpoint in the [Nager.Date API](https://date.nager.at/swagger/index.html)
```
### Holiday Discount Extensions:
```
Create a Holiday Discount

As a merchant,
when I visit the discounts index page,
In the Holiday Discounts section, I see a `create discount` button next to each of the 3 upcoming holidays.
When I click on the button I am taken to a new discount form that has the form fields auto populated with the following:

Discount name: <name of holiday> discount
Percentage Discount: 30
Quantity Threshold: 2

I can leave the information as is, or modify it before saving.
I should be redirected to the discounts index page where I see the newly created discount added to the list of discounts.
```
```
View a Holiday Discount

As a merchant (if I have created a holiday discount for a specific holiday),
when I visit the discount index page,
within the `Upcoming Holidays` section I should not see the button to 'create a discount' next to that holiday,
instead I should see a `view discount` link.
When I click the link I am taken to the discount show page for that holiday discount.
